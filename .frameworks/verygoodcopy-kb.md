## 207 Micro-Lessons on Thinking and Writing Like a Copywriter
**Author:** Eddie Shleyner

## Part 1: Core Concept

### What This Book Is About
VeryGoodCopy is a collection of 207 micro-lessons that teach copywriting through the dual lens of **mindset** (how to think) and **execution** (how to write). The book treats copywriting not as formulaic salesmanship, but as a craft rooted in human psychology, storytelling, and genuine connection.

### The Central Insight
**"Copywriting" is a misnomer—"copy researching" is more accurate.** The power of any ad lies in the product and the understanding of the audience, not in the cleverness of the writer. Great copy emerges from deep research, careful listening, and the ability to translate human desires into compelling messages.

### Why It Matters
Most marketing fails not because products are bad, but because messages are unclear, generic, or disconnected from what prospects actually want. Human nature is perpetual—the same psychological principles that worked a century ago work today. Master these principles, and you'll never need to "unlearn" them.

### The Mental Model Shift
- **From:** Writing = expressing clever ideas
- **To:** Writing = discovering and connecting ideas that already exist in your research
- **From:** Copywriters create demand
- **To:** Copywriters channel existing desires into action

## Part 2: Main Framework — The Two Pillars

### Pillar 1: THINKING Like a Copywriter (110 lessons on Mindset)
Principles and concepts for thinking concretely about:
- Creativity & ideation

- Research & discovery
- Success, failure, and ethics

### Pillar 2: WRITING Like a Copywriter (97 lessons on Execution)
Techniques for writing:

## Part 3: The Copywriting Process

### Step 1: Research Deeply
**"The power of the ad is always in the product itself. The copywriter simply finds it and expresses it."** —Eugene Schwartz

| Research Activity | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| Read the product/brief cover-to-cover | Identify every *claim* (promise) |
| Interview stakeholders | Find hidden stories, the "hooks" |
| Talk to real customers | Understand language, desires, objections |
| Study competitors | Find differentiation opportunities |

**Key Questions:**
- What does the prospect already know? (Level of Awareness)
- What's the story behind the product?
- What would a single, real person say about their problem?

**Eugene Schwartz's Research Standard:**
"I want to know the book as well as or *even better* than the author!"

### Step 2: Determine Level of Awareness
Before writing, identify where your prospects are:

| Level | Description | Approach |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1. Unaware | Don't know they have a problem | Educate about the problem |
| 2. Problem Aware | Know the problem, not solutions | Agitate the problem |
| 3. Solution Aware | Know solutions exist, not yours | Differentiate your solution |
| 4. Product Aware | Know your product, haven't bought | Overcome objections, provide proof |
| 5. Most Aware | Almost ready to buy | Make the offer, remove friction |

### Step 3: Find the Hook
**"You're not gonna find your story in the company line."**

- Talk to secretaries, salespeople, inventors
- Listen for the curious, fascinating detail
- The hook creates *interest* (the "I" in AIDA)

**Sales Detective Work:** The most compelling stories are often hidden. Ask questions, then listen.

### Step 4: Ideate Abundantly
**"95% of anyone's ideas are garbage."** —Scott Dikkers (The Onion)

- Generate 15-20+ ideas minimum
- Don't fetishize your only idea ("kill your darlings")
- The fewer ideas you have, the more weight each holds in your ego
- Volume reveals patterns; patterns reveal winners

### Step 5: Write the First Draft Carelessly
**"Write to get ideas, not to express them."** —Kevin Kelly

- Don't stop writing until done
- Don't start editing until done
- Writing is *pushing*; editing is *pulling*—never both at once
- Be a "careless artist" in draft mode

### Step 6: Edit Ruthlessly
**"Writing is 1% inspiration and 99% elimination."** —Louise Brooks

**Self-Editing Questions:**
1. Does this edit express the same idea, but faster?
2. Is this word absolutely necessary?
3. Do I *really* like this? (Trust your gut)

**When to Stop Editing:**
When you're making things *different*, not *better*.

### Step 7: Get Feedback (The CRIT System)
Gary Bencivenga's feedback method:
1. Distribute copy to as many people as possible
2. Invite them to "rip it apart"
3. Look for *patterns and themes* in feedback, not individual opinions
4. Consensus reveals what to rewrite

**Volume is the secret**—dozens of comments illuminate what's truly problematic.

## Part 4: Supporting Concepts & Frameworks

### The AIDA Formula
| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **A**ttention | Headline captures notice |
| **I**nterest | Hook creates curiosity |
| **D**esire | Benefits build wanting |
| **A**ction | CTA prompts behavior |

### PAS Formula (Problem-Agitation-Solution)
1. **Problem:** Identify the reader's issue
2. **Agitate:** Demonstrate consequences via story
3. **Solution:** Offer the clear way out

*Simple. Versatile. Proven.*

### The Life-Force 8 (Core Human Desires)
All ads should ultimately appeal to:
1. Survival, enjoyment of life, life extension
2. Enjoyment of food and beverages
3. Freedom from fear, pain, and danger
4. Physical companionship
5. Comfortable living conditions
6. Being superior, winning, keeping up
7. Care and protection of loved ones
8. Social approval

**"These powerful desires are responsible for more sales than all other human wants combined."** —Drew Eric Whitman

### Dimensionalizing Benefits
Don't stop at surface features. Keep asking "So what?" until you reach core desires.

**Example Process:**
- Feature: Extra-large art print
- Benefit 1: Fills wall space → So what?
- Benefit 2: Makes room feel complete → So what?
- Benefit 3: Guests notice and compliment → So what?
- **Core Benefit:** Social approval, feeling superior

### Proof Elements
| Type | Effect on Prospect |
|------|-------------------|
| Testimonials (volume matters) | "It worked for them; it'll work for me" |
| Guarantees (bolder = better) | "I've nothing to lose" |
| Demonstrations (dramatic = better) | "Seeing is believing" |

### Types of Advertising
| Type | Goal | Action Timing |
|------|------|---------------|
| Direct-Response | Immediate action | Now |
| Creative/General | Memorability | Later, when buying opportunity arises |

### Long Copy vs. Short Copy

**Long copy sells more** when:
- Prospect is genuinely interested
- Product requires explanation
- Copy is *transportive* (enables fantasy)

**Short copy works** when:
- Selling a commodity
- Audience is already aware
- Message is simple: "HORSE FOR SALE"

**No copy** when the visual tells the entire story.

## Part 5: Common Traps & Mistakes

### Research Mistakes
| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Writing before understanding | Research until writing becomes easy |
| Using personas (Frankensteins) | Study one real person deeply |
| Looking for hooks in company materials | Talk to secretaries, salespeople, inventors |
| Relying on swipe files as copy catalogs | Use swipes for learning and inspiration only |

### Writing Mistakes
| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Being clever over being clear | "Be clear, not clever" |
| Fancy words | Big ideas > big words |
| Too many adverbs | Replace with stronger verbs |
| Loud dialogue tags ("exclaimed") | Use only "said" or "asked" |
| Writing with ego (one precious idea) | Generate many ideas, kill darlings |
| Editing while drafting | Separate writing and editing completely |
| Over-promising (claims too good to be true) | Add "conditions" to ground claims |

### Headline Mistakes
| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Flat, invisible headlines | Add emotion, image, logic, promise |
| Headlines seen for their words | Headlines should be windows to the product |
| Headlines without news or self-interest | Use proven headline words |

### Mindset Mistakes
| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Waiting for inspiration | Show up and write; ideas come through writing |
| Perfectionism | "A poem is never finished, only abandoned" |
| Thinking AI can replace human connection | AI fetches info; only you can be vulnerable |
| Taking feedback personally | Focus on patterns, not individual opinions |
| Quitting | Success = showing up long enough to find your process |

### Copy That Crosses Lines
**"Crafting a story that tricks people into making short-term decisions they regret is the worst kind of marketing sin."** —Seth Godin

Don't mess with people's hope. Ads make promises—honor them.

## Part 6: Implementation Guide

### Daily Practice
- Write every day (athletes and musicians practice; so should writers)
- Study one ad or piece of copy deeply (look for 3+ hours like art students)
- Maintain a running document of insights (micro-lessons)

### What to Create

| Deliverable | Key Principle |
|-------------|---------------|
| Headlines | Emotion + Image + Logic + Promise |
| Body copy | Benefits dimensionalized to Life-Force 8 |
| CTAs | Direct and confident |
| Testimonials | Abundance triggers heuristics (LISH) |
| Image captions | 2nd most-read copy after headlines |
| Landing pages | Clear windows, not clever panes |

### How Copywriting Connects to Other Functions

| Function | Connection |
|----------|------------|
| Sales | Provide the language customers use |
| Product | Surface hidden stories and claims |
| Brand | Consistent voice and values |
| Customer Success | Collect transformation stories |
| Design | Collaborate from ideation (not assembly line) |

### When to Revisit
- When market changes (swipe files become dangerous)
- When testing reveals poor performance
- When customer language evolves
- When you've grown as a writer (you'll see old work differently)

## Part 7: Templates & Checklists

### Headline Checklist
Headlines should be at least one of:
- [ ] Dramatic (tells a story efficiently)
- [ ] Vivid (appeals to senses)
- [ ] Logical (asks a question)
- [ ] Hopeful (inspirational)
- [ ] Metaphorical
- [ ] Inherently valuable (teaches something)
- [ ] Direct (addresses prospect)
- [ ] Curious (opens a loop)

### Headline Word Bank

**Self-Interest Words:**
sale, save, easy, quick, results, proven, how to, guarantee, last chance

**News Words:**
new, now, at last, it's here, discover, breaking, just arrived, introducing, announcing

### Headline Techniques

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Impossible headline | "We waited 21 years for a train...and missed it!" |
| Incomplete headline | "Hungarian Conspiracy" |
| Question headline | "Has This Man Really Discovered the Secret of Inevitable Wealth?" |
| Story headline | "They Laughed When I Sat Down At the Piano—But When I Started to Play!" |

### Metaphor Templates
- "It's a [unexpected thing]."
- "It's [thing] meets [thing]."
- "It's a [familiar thing] for your [context]."

### Editing Process Template
1. Commit to final word count (e.g., 300 words)
2. Brain dump 4X first draft (1,200 words)
3. Cut first draft in half (600 words)
4. Cut second draft in half (300 words)

### Condition Words (for Credibility)
Use qualifiers to make claims believable:
- "almost"
- "usually"
- "believe it or not"
- "do it correctly, and..."

**"Why the price of silver *may* rise steeply" outperformed "will rise steeply" by 200%.**

### Feedback Collection Template (CRIT)
- [ ] Distribute to 10+ people (diverse roles)
- [ ] Ask them to "rip it apart"
- [ ] Collect notes: grammar, believability, clarity, engagement
- [ ] Tally themes (consensus = action item)
- [ ] Rewrite based on patterns, not outliers

### AI Usage Framework
**Use AI for:**
- Sourcing and organizing ideas
- Establishing dots to help *start* writing
- Research assistance

**Don't expect AI to:**
- Connect dots with human nuance
- Access your personal experiences
- Write with genuine vulnerability
- Replace the human condition

## Part 8: How to Use This Document

### Quick Reference
- **Stuck on headlines?** → See Headline Checklist & Word Bank
- **Copy feels flat?** → Dimensionalize benefits to Life-Force 8
- **Not sure what to write?** → Check Level of Awareness
- **Draft feels off?** → Run CRIT system
- **Struggling to start?** → Research more; write to get ideas

### Context Fields to Fill In

Before each project, answer:

```
PROJECT CONTEXT
---------------
Product/Service: _______________________
Target Prospect: _______________________
Level of Awareness: [ ] Unaware [ ] Problem [ ] Solution [ ] Product [ ] Most
Core Benefit (Life-Force 8): _______________________
The Hook (curious detail): _______________________
One Real Person's Words: _______________________
```

### Principles to Internalize

1. **Research > Writing** — Sloppy copywriters focus on writing; careful copywriters prioritize research
2. **Ideas > Words** — Copywriting is about ideas; sometimes the best copy is no copy
3. **Clarity > Cleverness** — Copy should be windows to the product, not art pieces
4. **Emotion > Logic** — The cornerstone of persuasion is feeling
5. **Process > Talent** — There is no right process; only what works for you
6. **Human > Perfect** — Vulnerability and authenticity resonate; perfection doesn't
