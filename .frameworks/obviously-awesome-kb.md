# Positioning Strategy Knowledge Base
## Based on April Dunford's "Obviously Awesome" + Strategic Consulting Frameworks

# PART 1: WHAT POSITIONING IS

**Positioning = Context Setting.** When customers encounter something new, they gather clues to figure out how to think about it. Positioning deliberately sets that context so your value becomes obvious.

**Why it matters:** Poor positioning makes prospects work harder to understand you. Even if you capture attention, they won't understand why they should buy. Positioning underpins your entire business strategy.

**Key insight:** Any product can be positioned in multiple markets. Your "default" positioning (what you originally intended to build) may not be optimal. Most products can be many things to many buyers.

# PART 2: THE 5+1 COMPONENTS

## 1. Competitive Alternatives
**Definition:** What customers would do/use if your product didn't exist.

**Key points:**
- NOT just direct competitors—includes "do nothing," spreadsheets, hire an intern, manual processes, cobbled-together tools
- Must be from CUSTOMER perspective, not yours
- Customers often don't know all alternatives; you must be the expert
- Usually 2-5 groups of alternatives after clustering

**Questions to ask:**
- What were customers doing before they found us?
- What would our best customers switch to if we disappeared?
- What do prospects compare us to in sales conversations?

---

## 2. Unique Attributes
**Definition:** Features/capabilities you have that alternatives lack.

**Types of attributes:**
- Technical features (patented tech, architecture, integrations)
- Business model (subscription vs. purchase, rental vs. ownership)
- Delivery model (SaaS vs. on-premise, self-serve vs. managed)
- Expertise/experience (specific industry knowledge, client base)
- Partnerships or ecosystem

**Key points:**
- List EVERYTHING, even if it seems negative to some customers
- Must be truly unique vs. the competitive alternatives you identified
- Patented features are obvious starting points
- For services: combination of skills + experience is often the differentiator

**Questions to ask:**
- What do customers say when asked why they chose us?
- What can we do that alternatives cannot?
- What would be hardest for competitors to copy?

---

## 3. Value (and Proof)
**Definition:** The benefit those attributes enable, translated into customer goals.

**Hierarchy:**
- Features → Benefits → Value
- Example: "15-megapixel camera" → "sharper images" → "photos sharp even when printed large"

**Key points:**
- Value must be mapped to things customers actually care about
- Cluster attributes into 1-4 value themes
- Must have PROOF: customer stories, data, third-party validation, demos
- Value without proof is just a claim

**Questions to ask:**
- So what? (keep asking until you hit something customers care about)
- Can we quantify this value? (time saved, money saved, revenue gained)
- What evidence do we have that this is true?

---

## 4. Target Market Characteristics
**Definition:** Traits of buyers who care MOST about your unique value.

**Key points:**
- Not a demographic segment—it's characteristics that make them care
- Actionable: sales/marketing must be able to identify these buyers
- Best-fit customers are those who buy quickly, rarely ask for discounts, tell others
- Start with your happiest existing customers—what do they have in common?

**Good characteristics examples:**
- Has a specific problem (e.g., "companies with field workers in remote locations")
- At a certain stage (e.g., "startups post-Series A scaling sales team")
- With specific constraints (e.g., "regulated industries requiring audit trails")
- Using specific tools (e.g., "teams already using Salesforce")

**Questions to ask:**
- Who are our happiest customers and what do they have in common?
- Who buys fastest with least friction?
- Who gets the most value and would be most upset if we disappeared?

---

## 5. Market Category
**Definition:** The frame of reference that makes your value obvious.

**What it does:**
- Triggers assumptions about competitors, features, pricing
- Helps customers quickly understand what you are
- Sets the context for evaluating your differentiation

**Key points:**
- Must exist in customers' minds (unless you're creating a new category)
- Choosing a category = choosing which comparisons customers make
- The "best" category puts your strengths at the center

**Category options:**
- Existing well-defined category
- Subsegment of existing category
- Adjacent category
- New category (rare, expensive, requires market education)

---

## 6. (Bonus) Relevant Trends
**Definition:** External forces that make your product more relevant NOW.

**Good trends:**
- Customers already aware of and interested in
- Makes your value more urgent or obvious
- You can credibly connect to

**Bad trend usage:**
- Trend-jacking without real connection
- Trends customers don't care about
- Trends that don't reinforce your differentiated value

**Examples:** AI/ML, remote work, sustainability, privacy regulations, digital transformation

# PART 3: THE 10-STEP PROCESS

## Step 1: Understand Customers Who Love Your Product
Start with best-fit customers—those who buy quickly, get value fast, rarely churn, and evangelize. Their perspective grounds everything.

## Step 2: Form a Positioning Team
- Cross-functional: marketing, sales, product, customer success, founder/exec
- Led by business leader (not just marketing)
- Consider external facilitator to challenge assumptions

## Step 3: Align Vocabulary + Let Go of Baggage
- Get everyone on same page about what positioning means
- Consciously set aside "default" positioning
- Be willing to see your product as something entirely different

## Step 4: List Competitive Alternatives
- From customer POV, not yours
- Include non-product alternatives
- Group into 2-5 clusters

## Step 5: Isolate Unique Attributes
- What you have that alternatives don't
- List everything—don't filter yet
- Include features, capabilities, expertise, business model

## Step 6: Map Attributes to Value Themes
- Translate features → benefits → value
- Cluster into 1-4 value themes
- Focus on what's truly differentiated, not every feature customers like

## Step 7: Determine Who Cares a Lot
- Which buyers care most about your differentiated value?
- Must be actionable characteristics
- Big enough to meet business goals
- Distinct, unmet needs

## Step 8: Pick Market Frame + Positioning Style
Choose one of three styles:

### Head-to-Head
- Position directly in existing category
- Use when: category exists, no dominant leader, you can win on category criteria
- Risk: fighting established players on their terms

### Big Fish, Small Pond
- Dominate a subsegment of existing category
- Use when: leader exists in broader category, but subsegment has distinct needs you serve better
- Requirements: subsegment big enough, needs truly distinct, you meet baseline category needs + excel for subsegment
- Risk: leader notices and targets your subsegment

### Create New Category
- Define an entirely new market
- Use when: no existing frame fits, you have resources to educate market
- Requirements: significant time/money, strong POV, willingness to evangelize
- Risk: expensive, slow, may fail to establish category

## Step 9: Layer on Relevant Trends (Optional)
- Only if trend genuinely reinforces your value
- Must be something customers care about
- Adds urgency/relevance, not core positioning

## Step 10: Capture and Share Positioning
- Document in enough detail for all teams to use
- Positioning canvas (one-page visual)
- Longer document with context and rationale
- NOT a positioning statement (too brief, too awkward)

# PART 5: COMMON TRAPS

## Trap 1: Stuck on Original Intent
You built a "cake" but it might be better positioned as a "snack." Don't let your original vision blind you.

## Trap 2: Positioning as Messaging
Positioning is not taglines or copy. It's the strategic foundation that INFORMS messaging.

## Trap 3: Starting with Category
Don't pick category first. Work through alternatives → attributes → value → customers THEN choose category.

## Trap 4: Features Without Value
Listing features nobody cares about. Always translate to customer value.

## Trap 5: Undifferentiated "Differentiation"
Claiming things alternatives also have. Must be truly unique.

## Trap 6: Too Broad Target
"Everyone" is not a segment. Narrow to who cares MOST.

---

# PART 6: AFTER POSITIONING

## Flows Into:
- **Marketing:** messaging, campaigns, audience targeting
- **Sales:** target segmentation, account strategy, sales story
- **Product:** roadmap priorities, feature decisions
- **Customer Success:** onboarding, expansion strategy

## The Sales Story Structure
1. Define the problem (for your target segment)
2. Describe how customers solve it today (alternatives)
3. Introduce the "perfect world" solution
4. Present your product as that solution
5. Prove it (customers, data, demo)

## When to Revisit Positioning
- New significant competitor enters
- Major product changes
- Market shifts (regulations, technology, economics)
- Target customers' perceptions change
- You're losing deals you should win

---

# PART 7: CONSULTING APPROACH

When working through positioning:

1. **Be hypothesis-driven:** Form a point of view, then test it
2. **Challenge assumptions:** Especially "default" positioning and internal beliefs
3. **Prioritize ruthlessly:** Not every feature or segment matters equally
4. **Quantify where possible:** Value claims need numbers
5. **Make it actionable:** If sales can't identify the target, it's useless
6. **Test with customers:** Positioning that sounds good internally may not resonate
