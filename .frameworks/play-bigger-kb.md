# PLAY BIGGER: Complete Knowledge Base
## How Pirates, Dreamers, and Innovators Create and Dominate Markets

---

## PART 1: CORE CONCEPT

### What This Book Is About
Play Bigger presents **Category Design**—a discipline for creating, developing, and dominating entirely new market categories. The central thesis: legendary companies don't just build great products or compete in existing markets—they create *new categories* that pull customers toward them and crown them as kings.

The authors (Al Ramadan, Dave Peterson, Christopher Lochhead, and Kevin Maney) argue that category kings capture **76% of the market capitalization** in their categories. There is no middle class in business—the wealth goes to kings. Second place gets crumbs.

### Why It Matters / The Problem It Solves
- **The "better" trap**: Companies focus on being *better* than competitors, but *different* wins. Better reinforces the existing king; different creates a new game.
- **The product fallacy**: Many believe "the best product wins." In reality, the company that *designs the category* wins.
- **Market noise**: In an era of infinite choice, customers use categories as mental shortcuts. If you don't define your category, someone else will.
- **Winner-take-all dynamics**: Networks, cloud distribution, and social media have intensified the speed at which kings emerge and take all economics.

### Key Mental Model Shift
**FROM:** "We build products and compete in markets"  
**TO:** "We design categories, companies, and products simultaneously—conditioning the market to demand our solution"

> "Disruption is a by-product, not a goal. Creation is the goal. Elvis didn't set out to 'disrupt' jazz—he set out to create rock and roll."

## PART 2: MAIN FRAMEWORK — THE MAGIC TRIANGLE

### The Three Elements of Category Design

Category kings design **three things simultaneously**:

| Element | Definition | Goal |
|---------|------------|------|
| **Product Design** | Purposeful building of a product/experience that solves the category's problem | Great product/category fit |
| **Company Design** | Purposeful creation of business model, organization, and culture that fits the category | Great company/category fit |
| **Category Design** | Mindful creation and development of a new market category | Position company as inevitable king |

### How They Work Together
- All three must be designed **at the same time**, not sequentially
- They reinforce each other in a **flywheel effect**
- The category must fit what the company can actually deliver (the "suit must fit")
- When synchronized: company = product = category become indistinguishable (Google IS search; Facebook IS social networking)

### The Flywheel Effect
When all three elements work in sync:
1. **Category potential** expands
2. **Position** as king solidifies  
3. **Execution** proves the company delivers
4. **Experience Curve** kicks in—king learns faster, produces cheaper
5. **Ecosystem** builds (developers, partners, talent, data)
6. **Money** flows to the king (funding, acquisitions)
7. **Talent** gravitates to the king
8. Momentum becomes nearly impossible to stop

## PART 3: STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

### Phase 1: Category Discovery

**Step 1: Identify the Insight**

Two types of insights spark category creation:

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Market Insight** | Seeing a "missing" in the market—an unmet need or opportunity | Airbnb: "People have extra space; travelers need affordable stays" |
| **Technology Insight** | Inventing something new, then finding the problem it solves | VMware: Virtualization tech seeking a use case |

**Dave's Three Questions** (diagnostic test for category potential):
1. Can you explain to me *like a five-year-old* what problem you're trying to solve?
2. If your company solves this problem perfectly, what category are you in?
3. If you win 85% of that category, what's the size of your category potential?

**Step 2: Fact Finding**

Interview executives, board members, advisors on eleven facets:
1. **Vision/Mission**: Original insight that led to founding
2. **Customers**: Who buys? Who uses?
3. **Problem Statement**: What problem do you solve?
4. **Use Cases**: Specific ways people use the solution
5. **Product/Solution**: Technical details and capabilities
6. **Ecosystem**: Other companies involved; control points
7. **Competition**: Who else is solving this (or might)?
8. **Business Model**: How does this change customer economics?
9. **Sales/Go-to-Market**: How will product reach market?
10. **Organization**: Structure, culture, decision-making
11. **Funding Strategy**: Next funding event, runway

**Step 3: Workshop**

Full-day session with leadership team to debate:
- Who are the customers?
- What problem don't they know they have?
- What are the FROM/TOs (the journey)?
- What's the new "thing" that must exist?

**Step 4: Name the Category**

- 2-3 words maximum
- Must describe the *problem being solved*
- Should speak to the business function (B2B) or be direct/descriptive (B2C)
- Should become a budget line item
- Must be *different*, not *better*

---

### Phase 2: Point of View (POV) Development

**What is POV?**
A POV is the company's *story*—an articulation of strategy that conditions the market to see the problem and demand the solution. It's emotional, not just factual.

**POV Structure** (like a movie trailer):
1. Frame the **problem** dramatically
2. Describe the **ramifications** of not solving it
3. Paint a **vision** for the category
4. Sketch a **blueprint** for how to build it
5. Show potential **outcomes**

**POV Principles:**
- Express *different*, not *better*
- Use human words, not business jargon
- Keep it simple and short
- Make it emotional—reach hearts, not just minds
- Never get into product features
- Should make people think: "Oh fuck, I don't have one of those!"

**Example POVs:**
- Salesforce: "The End of Software"
- GoPro: Point-of-view video for adventurers
- Sensity: Light Sensory Networks

---

### Phase 3: Mobilization

**Set a Lightning Strike Date**
- Schedule 3-6 months out
- Becomes the forcing function that mobilizes the entire company
- Like D-Day—work backward from the date

**The Four Seminal Mobilization Documents:**

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Category Blueprint** | Visual showing category architecture; proves you've thought it through |
| **Product Taxonomy** | Relabels product elements to sync with category; "truth" for describing offerings |
| **Use Cases** | Detailed customer scenarios; FROM/TO journeys for each customer type |
| **Category Ecosystem** | Maps all players involved; identifies control points |

**Mobilization Reality:**
- Every department must align behind the strike
- Products must work and deliver on the POV
- Sales must know use cases
- Marketing, branding, website must reflect category
- Watch for **Zeds**—people who won't buy in (eject them immediately)

---

### Phase 4: Lightning Strike

**What It Is:**
A concentrated, shock-and-awe event that breaks through market noise and plants the category in people's brains. NOT a marketing event—a *company event*.

**Purpose:**
- Condition the market to see the problem
- Establish your company as the category creator/leader
- Start the Experience Curve advantage
- Demoralize competitors

**Timing Options:**
- Hijack an industry event/conference
- Create your own summit
- Tie to product launch or funding event
- Use teaser "thunderclaps" beforehand

**Key Decisions:**
1. **Target audience**: Who specifically must hear this?
2. **Desired outcome**: What shift in thinking do you want?
3. **Venue/timing**: Where is your audience gathered?
4. **FROM/TO message**: What journey are you taking them on?

**Strike Requirements:**
- Air wars (perception/POV) + Ground wars (working products, ready sales)
- Every department aligned
- CEO fully committed
- Board informed

---

### Phase 5: Ongoing Hijacks and Category Development

**Pirate PR / Hijacks:**
- Opportunistically insert your category into news events
- Monitor for relevance moments
- Example: Salesforce hijacking Microsoft's Great Plains acquisition announcement

**Continuous Development:**
- Keep the flywheel spinning with ongoing mobilizations and strikes
- Expand category potential over time
- Build ecosystem (events, developer communities, partnerships)

---

## PART 4: SUPPORTING CONCEPTS

### Category Economics (76% Rule)
- Category kings capture ~76% of market cap in their category
- Data from analysis of VC-backed tech startups 2000-2015
- Example: Apple takes 93% of smartphone industry profits

### Category Lifecycle Model
Based on Geroski's research:
1. **Early stage**: Number of companies explodes; value rises slowly
2. **Middle stage**: Companies decline as king emerges; value rockets
3. **Domination stage**: Few survivors; king takes all; value peaks

**Sweet Spot**: IPO between 6-10 years after founding (when lines cross)

### The FROM/TO Journey (FroTo)
Every category design takes customers on a journey:
- **FROM**: Current way of thinking/acting
- **TO**: New frame of reference
- You must market the *problem* before the *solution*

### Gravity
The constant pull toward short-term, day-to-day decisions that work against category design:
- Quarterly pressures
- "Just ship it" mentality
- Resistance to change
- Scope creep

Lightning strikes and mobilization are the antidotes.

### Zeds
Employees who don't believe in the category and will sabotage it:
- Often appear persuasive
- Waste time and energy
- **Action**: Eject immediately upon identification

### Category Harvesting vs. Category Design
Two different strategies:

| Category Design | Category Harvesting |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Creating new categories | Milking existing category |
| Expansion mindset | Optimization mindset |
| High risk, high reward | Lower risk, steady returns |
| Designer CEO | Operator CEO |

Both are valid—but don't confuse them or try to do both at once.

### Experience Curve
BCG research showing market leaders:
- Gain knowledge faster than followers
- Make better products at lower cost
- Learn more about customers
- Compound advantages over time

Lightning strikes accelerate Experience Curve benefits.

## PART 5: COMMON TRAPS & MISTAKES

### What Most People Get Wrong

| Trap | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "Best product wins" | Different wins; best product gets a TechCrunch award |
| "First mover advantage" | First to *define and develop the category* wins |
| "Marketing is what you do with a shitty product" | Category design is company strategy |
| "Disruption is the goal" | Creation is the goal; disruption is a by-product |
| "Just ship it and they'll come" | You must condition the market to want it |
| "Listen to customers" | Customers lead to *better*; category design requires *different* |
| "We need more marketing budget" | Weak positioning won't improve with more money |

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Entering someone else's category**: Going head-to-head with an established king (Microsoft Bing vs. Google)
2. **Defining category without ability to deliver**: First movers fail if they can't be king (MySpace, Webvan)
3. **Leaving category to chance**: Believing the product speaks for itself
4. **Scope creep on POV**: Over-revising; "version 21" syndrome
5. **CEO hedging**: Must go all-in or mobilization fails
6. **Tolerating Zeds**: Letting skeptics remain on the team
7. **Listening to focus groups**: New categories are nonconsensus by definition
8. **Too much time**: Category windows close fast; 3-6 month mobilizations
9. **Better instead of different**: Competing on existing criteria vs. redefining the game

### The "Suit Must Fit"
- Vision too big = 8th grader in dad's suit (can't deliver)
- Vision too small = POV too cautious (missing opportunity)
- Must honestly assess capabilities vs. ambitions

---

## PART 6: IMPLEMENTATION

### How to Apply These Concepts

**For Startups:**
1. Begin with honest assessment of your insight (market or technology)
2. Answer Dave's Three Questions
3. Go through category discovery process
4. Develop POV before scaling marketing
5. Plan lightning strike 3-6 months out
6. Mobilize entire company behind strike
7. Execute strike and follow with ongoing hijacks

**For Large Companies:**
- Look for both technology insights (R&D) and market insights (relationships)
- Create separate teams for category creation vs. category harvesting
- Watch for the "better vs. different" trap from existing customers
- Example: Amazon creates new categories (AWS, Kindle) while harvesting retail

### Key Outputs/Deliverables

| Deliverable | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Category Name | 2-3 words defining the new problem space |
| POV Document | 1-2 page strategic story |
| Category Blueprint | Visual architecture of the category |
| Product Taxonomy | Relabeled product elements |
| Use Cases | Detailed customer journey documents |
| Ecosystem Map | All players and control points |
| Lightning Strike Plan | Date, venue, audience, messages, mobilization checklist |

### Connection to Other Business Functions

| Function | How Category Design Affects It |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| **Product** | Features named and organized around category; roadmap aligned to blueprint |
| **Sales** | Pitch reframed around problem/solution; trained on POV and use cases |
| **Marketing** | All content, website, campaigns aligned to POV |
| **HR/Recruiting** | POV attracts right people, repels wrong ones |
| **Investor Relations** | POV shapes investor expectations (Bezos letters) |
| **Partnerships** | Ecosystem strategy guides partner selection |

### When to Revisit Positioning

**Triggers for reassessment:**
- Category potential running out (stock stuck despite good profits)
- New technology enabling different solutions
- Shift in customer attitudes/preferences
- Competitive landscape changes
- Regulatory shifts
- You can count your potential customers
