# The 22 Laws of Category Design
## Complete Knowledge Base

---

# Part 1: Core Concept

## What This Book Is About
Category design is a business discipline that helps companies earn the majority of the value created in a specific new or different category of products or services. It's about **creating** new categories rather than **competing** in existing ones.

**The Core Premise:** Don't compete to be "better"—design something **different**. The best product doesn't always win. The best brand doesn't always win. But the company that designs and dominates a new category captures 76% of the total market value created.

## The Problem It Solves
Most businesses waste time and resources fighting for demand in categories they didn't create, competing for the remaining 24% of category economics. They fall into "The Better Trap"—trying to be a better version of what already exists, which invites comparison and commoditization.

## The Key Mental Model Shift

| Old Thinking | Category Design Thinking |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Compete for existing demand | Create net-new demand |
| Build the best product | Build a different product |
| Market your brand | Market the category |
| Fight for market share | Focus on wallet share |
| Forecast from the past | Backcast from the future |
| Accept the premise | Reject the premise |
| Reflexive thinking | Reflective thinking |

**Core Insight:** Everything is the way it is because somebody changed the way it was. Category designers stand in a different future and pull the present toward it.

# Part 2: Main Framework/Model

## The Magic Triangle

The primary framework with three interdependent sides:

```
           PRODUCT DESIGN
                /\
               /  \
              /    \
             /      \
            /________\
    COMPANY          CATEGORY
    DESIGN            DESIGN
```

### Component Definitions

| Side | Definition | Goal |
|------|------------|------|
| **Product Design** | Purposeful building of a product/experience that solves the problem the category needs solved | Product/Category Fit |
| **Company Design** | Purposeful creation of a business model and organization with a culture and POV that fits the new category | Right business model + missionary team |
| **Category Design** | Mindful creation and development of a new market category, designed so the category pulls in customers who make the company king | Teaching the world to abandon old, embrace new |

### How They Relate
- All three sides work together and balance each other
- You can get product or company wrong and tweak over time
- **Category is the single point of failure**—get it wrong and you're finished
- No category = no market = no company

### The Data Flywheel (Inside the Triangle)
When you prosecute all three sides successfully, you unlock your most valuable asset:
1. Breakthrough product + innovative business model + new/different future → Category Queen
2. Category Queen status → data accumulation creates "unfair advantage"
3. Unfair advantage → best positioned for next category creation opportunity
4. Cycle repeats

## The 22 Laws Organized by Section

### Part 1: Foundational Thinking (Laws 1-5)
| Law | Title | Core Principle |
|-----|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Thinking About Thinking Is the Most Important Kind of Thinking | Expertise is the enemy of fresh thinking. Move from reflexive to reflective thinking. |
| 2 | The Category Queen Captures 76% of the Economics | One company wins big in each category. Digital categories amplify this. |
| 3 | Your Category Is the Single Point of Failure | The Magic Triangle framework. No category, no company. |
| 4 | Build for Your Superconsumer, Not Every Consumer | Supers are 10% of consumers but drive 30-70% of sales. |
| 5 | A Superconsumer of One Category Is a Superconsumer of Nine | Wallet share > market share. Supers unlock adjacent categories. |

### Part 2: Category (Laws 6-9)
| Law | Title | Core Principle |
|-----|-------|----------------|
| 6 | Category First, Brand Second | The category makes the brand, not vice versa. |
| 7 | Position Yourself or Be Positioned | Niche down, specialize, then hitch your niche to a rocket ship. |
| 8 | Whoever Frames the Problem Owns the Solution | Languaging—strategic use of language to create or change thinking. |
| 9 | Category Neglect → Violence → Death | Complacency kills. Innovate or be overtaken. |

### Part 3: Product (Laws 10-15)
| Law | Title | Core Principle |
|-----|-------|----------------|
| 10 | The Best Product Doesn't Always Win | Products can't speak for themselves—you must speak for them. |
| 11 | Be Different, Not Better | Better invites comparison. Different forces a choice. |
| 12 | Create Net-New Demand, Don't Fight Over Existing | Idiots fight over scarce resources. Create new ones. |
| 13 | When You Can't Create Net-New, DAM the Demand | Redirect existing demand with category-vs-category education. |
| 14 | Sell Digital Air | Create intangible value with near-zero marginal costs. |
| 15 | Pricing: Free or Ultra Expensive (Avoid the Middle) | Price for Superconsumers, not average consumers. |

### Part 4: Company (Laws 16-22)
| Law | Title | Core Principle |
|-----|-------|----------------|
| 16 | The Best Business Model Doesn't Always Win | Innovate delivery and revenue models, not just products. |
| 17 | Mercenaries Capture Value, Missionaries Create Value | Be mission-driven, stand in the future, create abundance. |
| 18 | Bake Radical Generosity into Your Business | Radical generosity is a fixed cost, like rent. |
| 19 | Only Three Marketing Metrics Matter | Revenue, category potential, and market cap. |
| 20 | Legendary Marketing Plans Create a Different Future | Lightning Strikes align Information, Air, and Ground games. |
| 21 | Simplicity Is Velocity | Simple offers to clear problems. Get from "Huh?" to "I'm buying" fast. |
| 22 | When Word of Mouth Sticks, Your Category Tips | Right words + right mouths + right places = WOM wildfire. |

# Part 3: Step-by-Step Process

## How to Frame, Name, and Claim a Category

### Step 1: Frame a Different Problem/Opportunity
- Your POV is what "hooks" the customer by framing a new problem and new solution in a provocative way
- The language must reflect your unique, unwavering point of view
- Example: Pfizer invented "erectile dysfunction" to reframe "impotence"

**Key Question:** What problem does the world not yet know it has?

### Step 2: Evangelize a Different Future
- Stand in a different future and live "as if" it already exists
- Use backcasting (standing in future, pulling present) vs. forecasting (standing in past, looking forward)

**Examples:**
- Stitch Fix: "Receive curated boxes of clothing, selected just for you"
- Netflix: "Stream shows on your schedule instead of planning your life around them"

### Step 3: Show How Your Solution Bridges the Gap
- Show customers how your solution bridges from problem to different future
- Market the problem, become the solution
- Use Languaging that creates thinking, which inspires action

**Examples of Languaging:**
- Starbucks: "grande" and "venti" (not small/medium/large)
- Netflix: "streaming" vs "appointment viewing"
- Henry Ford: "horseless carriage"

---

## The Lightning Strike Marketing Strategy

### Three Pillars of Every Lightning Strike

**1. The Information Game**
- What you're saying (POV)
- How you're saying it (Languaging)
- To whom (Superconsumers)
- Goal: Get POV in mouths of Supers who spread WOM

**2. The Air Game**
- Selling at scale, 24/7
- Strategic marketing in service of the new category
- Focused on demand *creation*
- Examples: Whitepapers, conferences, thought leadership, category-defining ads

**3. The Ground Game**
- Tactical marketing at point of sale
- Making the cash register sing *today*
- Focused on demand *capture* and lead generation
- Examples: DAM the Demand marketing, testimonials, product launches

**Resource Allocation:** Invest ~1/3 of resources into each game.

---

## DAM the Demand Strategy (3 Steps)

Use when you can't create net-new demand:

### Step 1: Place a Differentiating Modifier in Front
Tell the truth about the existing category:
- "It's not coffee. It's *cold-brew* coffee."
- "It's not AI. It's *generative* AI."
- "It's not a watch. It's a *smart* watch."

**Naming Principles:**
- New categories are often named by what they're NOT
- "Horseless carriage," "wireless phone," "sugar-free"
- Modifier should hint at pain point of legacy category

### Step 2: Highlight Issue with Legacy Business Model
- Not just product differences—business model differences
- Netflix: "binge-watching" vs. "windowing" (appointment viewing)
- Attack the incentive structure of the old category

### Step 3: Move Customers FROM Old TO New (FROTOs)
- Cool, calm education on "the gap"
- Truth-telling that permanently disables legacy category
- No sales pitch, no shouting—just category vs. category debate

---

## Size of Prize Analysis (4 Steps)

### Step 1: Be Crystal Clear on Context
Answer three questions:
1. Who is the audience for the analysis?
2. What decisions will they make based on it?
3. How deep must the analysis go?

**Depth Levels:**
- Solo-worthy: Good enough for personal decisions
- Social media-worthy: Robust enough to defend publicly
- S-1-worthy: Credible for IPO documentation

### Step 2: Triage, Tag, and Triangulate Existing Data
**Performance Data (Past/Present):**
- Accounting data (sales, profits)
- Benchmarking data (market shares)
- Cross-functional performance data

**Potential Data (Future):**
- Near-term quantifiable demand
- Trend data from credible sources
- Cross-functional potential data

### Step 3: Create New, Credible Data
Three types:
1. **Opinion Fact-Base:** Surveys, focus groups, interviews
2. **Outcomes Fact-Base:** Test-and-learn, pilots, experiments
3. **Super-Geos Fact-Base:** Combines real outcomes + Superconsumer density

### Step 4: Assemble Puzzle, Make Decision, Tell Story
- Let data sit, look for patterns
- Frame data in context of audience and decisions
- Construct compelling story, make go/no-go decision

# Part 4: Supporting Concepts

## Superconsumers Deep Dive

### Characteristics of Supers
- ~10% of category consumers (not your customers)
- Drive 30-70% of sales, even greater share of profit
- 100% of the insights
- Emotional buyers based on life aspirations
- NOT price sensitive
- More predictable than other consumers
- Leave digital breadcrumbs everywhere
- Best word-of-mouth evangelists

### The Super of 1 = Super of 9 Rule
A Superconsumer of one category is also a Super of up to 9 other categories.

**Example:** Movie Superconsumer is also likely Super of:
- Movie snacks (popcorn, candy)
- Home theater equipment
- Streaming services
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Movie memorabilia

**Implication:** Focus on wallet share, not market share. Acquire a Super once, monetize nine times.

### LTV Equation for Supers
1. Frequency of purchase → Supers buy a lot and often
2. Average gross margin → Supers pay premium prices
3. Years in category → Supers have highest lifespan
4. Churn/retention rate → Very low for Supers
5. Word of mouth → Exponentially higher for Supers
6. Categories cross-sold → Super of 1 = Super of 9

---

## Super-Geos: Geographic Superconsumer Clusters

### What Are Super-Geos?
Locations (physical or digital) with high density of Superconsumers. Not continents or countries—think state, city, zip code, or specific online communities.

### 10-Step Recipe to Find Super-Geos
1. Get your data by geography at most granular level
2. Convert to per capita metric
3. Compare per capita to year-over-year growth (build S-curve)
4. Append other per capita metrics using geography as common denominator
5. Compare per capita metrics across categories (even unrelated ones)
6. Review data with diverse audience (experts, novices, Supers, nonusers)
7. Get longitudinal data for time series analysis
8. Combine with government data (NOAA, CDC, labor stats, etc.)
9. Identify markets with compelling per capita + clear causal factors
10. Find potential Super-Geos: markets with all causal factors but lower spending

## The 8 Category Levers for Differentiation

### Product/Offer Side
1. **Radically different benefit**
2. **Radically different brand**
3. **Radically different experience**
4. **Radically different price**

### Business Model Side
5. **Radically different manufacturing**
6. **Radically different distribution**
7. **Radically different marketing**
8. **Radically different profit model**

**Minimum requirement:** At least one lever on product side + at least one on business model side.

---

## Missionary vs. Mercenary Distinction

| Mercenaries | Missionaries |
|-------------|--------------|
| Fight over old things | Create new things |
| Have secrets, build in stealth | No secrets about vision for the world |
| Fight over market share | Believe mission > market cap |
| Capture value | Create value |
| Make money when bad things happen to customers | Make money when good things happen to customers |
| Maximize/exploit "today" | See future where everyone wins |

**Test Question:** Does your company make money when good things or bad things happen to customers?

---

## Category Neglect → Violence → Death Cycle

### Category Neglect
- Refusing to acknowledge which direction the wind is blowing
- Dismissing niche categories growing quickly
- Contempt for competitors, customers, or suppliers
- Example: Toys"R"Us ignoring e-commerce, signing exclusive Amazon deal

### Category Violence
- Other companies witness neglect and attack
- New entrant positions legacy as obsolete
- Example: Apple's "1984" Super Bowl ad attacking IBM

### Category Death
- Category King loses position or goes out of business
- Sometimes kills entire old category (landlines, atlas maps, minicomputers)
- If category is lost, company is finished

**Prevention:** Constantly innovate, create the future, avoid complacency.

---

## Digital Air Concept

### Definition
Digital products or services with no physical substance and minimal production costs, but high value to customers.

### Examples
Software, warranties, e-books, podcasts, templates, audiobooks, videos, courses, webinars, digital art, games, VR experiences, memberships, subscriptions, cloud storage, digital communities, loyalty points/miles

### Why It Matters
- Near-zero marginal cost
- Infinite scalability
- Increasing-returns business model
- Can be most profitable part of business
- Example: American Airlines AAdvantage—$5.9B revenue, 53% cash profit margin

---

## Pricing Framework

### The Equation
**Value = Benefits / Price**

Price should reflect value when benefits are divided by price. Value is 100% perception—everything you value, you've been taught to value.

### Radical Pricing Options
- More benefits at same price
- Same benefits at lower price
- 3x benefits for 2x price
- 75% benefits for 50% lower price
- More benefits AND lower price = rocket ship (rare)

### Key Principle
Price for your Superconsumers, not all consumers. Supers are NOT price sensitive—they have emotional and aspirational connections.

**Anti-pattern:** Benchmarking against competitors leads to commodity pricing.

---

# Part 5: Common Traps/Mistakes

## The Better Trap
**Mistake:** Competing on features, price, and "brand" to be "better" than competitors.
**Result:** Drives down margins, commoditization, fighting for 24% of category value.
**Solution:** Be different, not better. Different forces a choice; better invites a comparison.

## The Best Product Lie
**Mistake:** Believing "the best product always wins."
**Reality:** A product can be beautiful, stunning, complex, and brilliant—but that doesn't mean it matters. Products can't speak for themselves.
**Solution:** Prosecute all three sides of Magic Triangle together.

## The Brand-First Fallacy
**Mistake:** Believing "great brands make great categories."
**Reality:** Categories make brands. Kodak, Marriott, and GM had great brands but lost to category creators.
**Solution:** Category first, brand second. Your brand follows from your category.

## Fighting for Existing Demand
**Mistake:** Competing for keywords, market share, existing customer pools.
**Reality:** Only idiots fight over scarce resources.
**Solution:** Create net-new demand. Grow banana trees instead of fighting over bananas.

## Myopic Product Focus
**Mistake:** "We built an unbeatable product"—then waiting for customers to "get it."
**Reality:** People don't understand problems, opportunities, or differences without education.
**Solution:** Make a place in the world for your product. Speak for it.

## Messaging Without POV
**Mistake:** "We need to work on our messaging" when actually lacking a category point of view.
**Symptom:** Messages conflict with each other, weak aims, evangelizing different categories.
**Solution:** Define unwavering POV first, then test messaging variations.

## Expertise Trap
**Mistake:** Relying on experts who analyze the past.
**Reality:** Nobel Prizes awarded for work done decades ago. Consultants explain yesterday.
**Solution:** Don't strive to become an expert. Expertise is the enemy of fresh thinking.

## The "Disruption" Delusion
**Mistake:** Focusing on "disrupting" existing players.
**Reality:** Disruption is tearing down the old, not creating the new.
**Solution:** Focus on creation, not destruction. Elvis didn't disrupt Sinatra—he created rock 'n' roll.

## Marketing Planning from the Past
**Mistake:** Using last year's plan as template, incremental improvements.
**Result:** CFO decides the slogan, debates about Facebook vs. Instagram ads.
**Solution:** Lightning Strike strategy creating a different future.

## "Do I Like It?" Lens
**Mistake:** Evaluating marketing like a movie, recipe, or naming a cat.
**Correct Lens:** "Does this work?" Does it help design and dominate a giant category?

## How It Connects to Other Business Functions

| Function | Connection |
|----------|------------|
| **Product Development** | Build for Superconsumers, not everyone. Product/category fit. |
| **Sales** | Ground Game execution. DAM the Demand at point of sale. |
| **Finance** | Size of prize drives valuation. Pricing strategy for Supers. |
| **HR/Culture** | Missionary vs. mercenary hiring. Company design. |
| **Customer Success** | Identify and nurture Superconsumers. Radical generosity. |
| **Investor Relations** | Category potential narrative. Market cap metrics. |

---

## When to Revisit/Update

- **Quarterly:** Review Lightning Strike effectiveness across all three games
- **Annually:** Re-assess category position, check for neglect signals
- **Trigger Events:**
  - New competitor entering category (potential category violence)
  - Technology shifts affecting category
  - Superconsumer behavior changes
  - Category growth slowing or accelerating
  - M&A opportunities

**Timeline Reality:** It takes 6-10 years to create a category and have it tip at scale. Don't expect immediate world-changing results in 30 days.

   - Are you #1, #2, or lower?
   - Is it growing, stable, or declining?

2. **Your Desired Category:**
   - What new category could you design?
   - What's the problem the world doesn't know it has?

---

## Key Reminders

1. **Category is the single point of failure.** You can fix product and company over time, but wrong category = finished.

2. **Category Queen captures 76% of economics.** Digital categories amplify this. Being #2 caps your upside at 24%.

3. **Create demand, don't compete for it.** Legendary companies grow banana trees instead of fighting over bananas.

4. **Build for Superconsumers.** They're 10% of consumers but 30-70% of sales and 100% of insights.

5. **Category first, brand second.** The category makes the brand, not vice versa.

6. **Be missionary, not mercenary.** Create value, don't just capture it.

7. **Takes 6-10 years.** Category design is a long game. Don't expect overnight results.

8. **Reject the premise.** Everything is the way it is because somebody changed the way it was.

## Radical Generosity Examples

| Company | Radical Generosity Practice |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Ben & Jerry's | Free Cone Day—free ice cream to customers worldwide |
| Salesforce | 1-1-1 Model: 1% equity + 1% employee time + 1% products to charity |
| Netflix | Release entire seasons at once for binge-watching |
| Lil Wayne | Released dozens of mixtapes and hundreds of songs free online |
| Keurig | Welcomed competing brands (even Starbucks) into their ecosystem |
| See's Candies | Gives away 1 million pounds of chocolate/year (~1/26th of revenue) |
| Southwest Airlines | No hidden fees built into business model |
| Tesla | Open-sourced patents for electric vehicle technology |

**Key Insight:** Radical generosity is a fixed cost, like rent. Account for it in your business model from the start.

---

## Three Company Risks

Every company faces three risks when pursuing the Magic Triangle:

| Risk Type | Question | Flexibility |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Execution Risk** | Can we create a meaningful product in the time frame that matters? | Can tweak over time |
| **Competition Risk** | Are we the team/business capable of winning the category battle? | Can tweak over time |
| **Category Risk** | Are we naming and claiming the category wherein we are undisputed King/Queen? | **SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE** |

---

## Three Marketing Metrics That Matter

1. **Marketing that drives Revenue**
   - Makes the cash register sing
   - No revenue = no business
   - Marketing without revenue = "arts and crafts"

2. **Marketing that drives Category Potential**
   - Expands total addressable market
   - Educates world about new/different future
   - Creates sense of inevitability

3. **Marketing that drives Market Cap**
   - Sells potential to investors
   - Category potential > current performance
   - Creates FOMO, word of mouth at scale

---

## POV Examples from Category Leaders

| Company | Point of View |
|---------|--------------|
| **Stitch Fix** | Busy people don't have time to shop for clothes, but they want nice clothes that fit their unique style |
| **Vinebox** | Buying an entire bottle of premium wine only to not enjoy what you've just bought is a terrible experience |
| **Netflix** | You should be able to watch anything you want, whenever you want |
| **UNTUCKit** | Regular shirts look like tents when untucked; shirts should be purpose-built to be untucked |
| **Lemonade** | Insurance should work for customers, not against them |
| **Tesla** | Sustainable energy will save our planet; gasoline is the past |

### Step 2: Take Each to Extreme (10x)
For each lever, what if you went 10x different?
- Product Lever #1 at 10x: _____________
- Product Lever #2 at 10x: _____________
- Business Model Lever #1 at 10x: _____________
- Business Model Lever #2 at 10x: _____________

### Step 3: Do the Opposite (George Costanza Method)
What if you did the exact opposite of current approach?
- Product Lever #1 opposite: _____________
- Product Lever #2 opposite: _____________
- Business Model Lever #1 opposite: _____________
- Business Model Lever #2 opposite: _____________

### Step 4: Apply Admired Company Lens
If [Disney/Apple/Amazon] acquired you, how would they change each lever?
- Product Lever #1 "Disney-fied": _____________
- Product Lever #2 "Disney-fied": _____________
- Business Model Lever #1 "Disney-fied": _____________
- Business Model Lever #2 "Disney-fied": _____________

### Step 5: Select Most Exciting
**Idea:** _____________
**Why exciting:** _____________
**Game-changing because:** _____________
**Unique because:** _____________
**Feasible because:** _____________
**Test & Learn approach:** _____________

---

## Obvious vs. Non-Obvious Content

| Obvious Content | Non-Obvious Content |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Speaks to what people already think/believe | Educates on what they haven't thought about |
| Caters to reflexive nature | Requests reflective nature |
| For audiences in "autopilot" mode | For audiences seeking fresh insights |
| Confirms preconceived notions | Challenges mental models |

**Critical Matching:**
- Reflexive thinkers want Obvious content
- Reflective thinkers want Non-Obvious content
- Mismatch = frustration either way

---

## Category Design Warning Signs

### Signs of Category Neglect
- [ ] Dismissing growing niche categories as "fads"
- [ ] Contempt for competitors, customers, or suppliers
- [ ] Investing more in procurement than innovation
