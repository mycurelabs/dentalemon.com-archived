# OVERSUBSCRIBED: Complete Knowledge Base
*By Daniel Priestley*

---

## Part 1: Core Concept

### What the Book is About
**Oversubscribed** is a strategic framework for creating market conditions where demand for your product or service far exceeds your capacity to deliver it. Rather than chasing clients, oversubscribed businesses have clients lining up for them.

Being oversubscribed occurs when there are far more buyers than sellers—when many more people want something than capacity allows for. This creates a market imbalance that enables premium pricing, selective client relationships, and sustainable profitability.

### Why It Matters
The market abhors a profit. Profit is only tolerated when demand exceeds supply. If everyone who wants what you have can get it, prices fall and margins erode. Being oversubscribed is the only sustainable path to profitability.

**The fundamental truth:** Markets go up because there are more buyers than sellers—and that's it. Your price isn't fixed or set by the overall market; it's the result of being oversubscribed or not.

### Key Mental Model Shift
**From:** Linear, one-at-a-time client acquisition (meet client → sell → deliver → repeat)

**To:** Campaign-driven waves (build interest with 100 prospects → select 20 to work with → deliver remarkable experience → repeat)

Stop behaving like a "business" (busy-ness) and become a **Campaign Driven Enterprise** focused on running powerful campaigns in strategic waves.

## Part 2: Main Framework — The Campaign Driven Enterprise Method

### The Five-Phase Framework

| Phase | Focus | Goal |
|-------|-------|------|
| **1. Planning** | Know capacity, who it's for, when to deliver | Set 12-month rolling campaign schedule |
| **2. Build-Up** | Signal intentions, educate, entertain | Create sufficient interest (5-100x capacity) |
| **3. Release** | Announce availability when oversubscribed | Allow selected people to buy |
| **4. Remarkable Delivery** | Exceed expectations | Leave clients uplifted |
| **5. Celebrate & Innovate** | Share stories, capture numbers, learn | Prepare for next campaign |

### The Seven Core Principles

**Principle 1: Demand and Supply Set the Price**
- More buyers than sellers = profits tolerated
- Balanced demand/supply = wages only
- More sellers than buyers = losses

**Principle 2: Separate Yourself from the Market**
- Create your own market independent of industry
- Build a tribe loyal to your business, philosophy, and personality
- You don't need everyone—you only need enough to be oversubscribed

**Principle 3: Four Drivers of Market Imbalance**

| Driver | How It Creates Imbalance | Opposite Cannot Combine |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Innovation** | Only one seller (you) of something new | Convenience |
| **Relationships** | Buyers ignore other sellers | Price |
| **Convenience** | Buyers reluctant to find alternatives | Innovation |
| **Price** | Asset-based efficiency others can't match | Relationships |

*Choose one primary driver and one secondary. You cannot be both ends of an axis.*

**Principle 4: Buying Environments Create Buyers**
- People don't buy what others want to sell—they buy what others want to buy
- Buying behavior is stimulated by the buying environment
- Turn clients into celebrities; showcase their success

**Principle 5: It's OK to Be Different**
- It's OK to fail (shows demand exceeds capacity)
- It's OK to say "No" (fussy businesses are better)
- It's OK to make people wait (builds anticipation)
- It's OK to buck the trend (philosophy creates market)

**Principle 6: Value is Created in the Ecosystem**
- Give away ideas; charge for implementation
- Smaller stairs beat big walls (low-risk first steps)
- Don't mess with a winning formula

**Principle 7: Nothing Beats Being Positively Remarkable**
- Replace marketing budget with "remarkable budget"
- Build a remarkably trusted personal brand
- Your clients are your marketing team

## Part 3: Step-by-Step Process

### PHASE 1: Campaign Planning

#### Step 1.1: Define Your Perfect Client
Questions to answer:
- Who is perfect in every way—enjoyable, pays on time, refers others?
- What were they looking to achieve before becoming your client?
- What problem were they trying to solve?
- What made their world less than perfect?

#### Step 1.2: Determine Your Capacity
**Key Question:** How many clients can you truly DELIGHT (not just serve)?

*Capacity = ability to deliver remarkable results that leave people uplifted*

- Be honest about limitations
- If current capacity to delight is zero, start with one
- Consider: What's the bottleneck? Staff? Equipment? Your creativity?

#### Step 1.3: Calculate Campaign Numbers

| Calculation | Formula |
|-------------|---------|
| Annual client goal | [Your capacity to delight] |
| Campaigns per year | 3–10 typical |
| Clients per campaign | Annual goal ÷ Number of campaigns |
| Clients per quarter | Annual goal ÷ 4 |
| Clients per month | Annual goal ÷ 10 (assume 10 productive months) |

#### Step 1.4: Create Your 12-Month Campaign Schedule
1. Block out holidays and personal time first
2. Block out training and development (5–15% of income)
3. Add quarterly planning days
4. Map campaign launch dates
5. Set sales targets for each campaign

#### Step 1.5: Create Campaign Theme
**Don't just promote products—talk about something bigger:**
- Lifestyle of customers
- Your philosophy
- A big problem to solve
- The transformation you want to see

*Example: Chipotle talks about "cultivating a better world," not burritos*

#### Step 1.6: Build Campaign Timeline
Components to schedule:
1. Start and finish dates
2. Communications schedule (emails, direct mail, PR, ads)
3. Milestones (price rises, cut-off dates, early bird specials)
4. Supporting events (partnerships, pre-launch, celebrations)
5. Main events (seminars, launches, parties)
6. Shipping/delivery dates
7. Post-campaign activity (stories, reporting, follow-up, thank-yous)

---

### PHASE 2: Build-Up

#### Step 2.1: Signal Your Intentions
**What to Signal:**
- What's coming
- When it will be available
- Limited capacity
- Who it's for
- Terms and conditions

**How to Signal:**
- Pre-registration pages
- Email announcements
- Social media posts
- Events and presentations

*Example: Glastonbury Festival asks attendees to pre-register, signals dates, shares demand numbers (350,000 registered for 120,000 tickets)*

#### Step 2.2: Name Your Terms
State openly:
- Who you want to work with
- How many people you can serve
- On what terms you'll work with them
- Dress code, policies, requirements

*Naming terms shows confidence and makes you more desirable*

#### Step 2.3: Ask for Signals Back (Not the Sale)
**Don't ask:** "Would you like to buy?"
**Ask:** "Would you like to register your interest?"

Signal requests by strength:

| Signal Type | Examples | Multiplier Needed |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | Deposits, pre-payments, finance applications | 5x capacity |
| **Moderate** | Event attendance, detailed surveys, products-for-prospects | 10x capacity |
| **Soft** | Downloads, email opt-ins, video views, competition entries | 100x capacity |

#### Step 2.4: Create Transparency
- Make it visible that demand exceeds supply
- Show lines forming (physical or digital)
- Use social proof (Facebook comments, Twitter hashtags)
- Share numbers openly

*"There's one of me and lots of you"*

#### Step 2.5: Educate and Entertain
**The 80/20 Rule:**
- Educational events: 80% education + 20% entertainment
- Entertainment events: 80% entertainment + 20% education

**Education tools:** Trainings, seminars, webinars, workshops, reports, consultations
**Entertainment tools:** Sport, music, art, food, drinks, humor, parties

#### Step 2.6: Apply the 7-Hour Rule
Big purchasing decisions take ~7 hours of accumulated thinking/engagement.

**Goal:** Clock up 7 hours with as many qualified prospects as possible through:
- Articles, blogs, books
- Videos, podcasts
- Events, workshops
- Consultations, calls
- Social media engagement

*Google calls these "Zero Moments of Truth"—11 touches to build trust*

**Key insight:** The brain can't distinguish digital from real—content consumption counts as relationship building.

#### Step 2.7: Create Products-for-Prospects
Products designed to educate/entertain and capture interest, not generate primary revenue:
- Books
- Reports/white papers
- Workshops/webinars
- Software downloads
- Samples
- Assessments/quizzes
- Merchandise

*Goal: 25x more product-for-prospect buyers than your client capacity*

---

### PHASE 3: Release When Oversubscribed

#### Step 3.1: Verify You're Sufficiently Oversubscribed

| Signal Strength | Threshold |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Strong signals (deposits) | 5x capacity |
| Moderate signals (event attendance) | 10x capacity |
| Soft signals (downloads) | 100x capacity |

**If not hit:** Continue signaling and educating until you reach one threshold

#### Step 3.2: Selection Process
You now SELECT who you want as clients:
- Die-hard fans make the best clients
- People who needed arm-twisting will cause trouble
- Selectivity creates self-fulfilling prophecy

#### Step 3.3: Manage Energy with Release Tactics

**Tactic 1: Staged Release**
Release capacity in smaller chunks over time
- First batch/early bird quantity
- Follow-up with "additional availability"

*Example: Monty Python released 5,000 tickets (sold in 45 seconds), then announced 9 more shows*

**Tactic 2: Special Editions**
Break capacity into sub-groups:
- Industry-specific versions
- Demographic-specific versions
- Feature-enhanced versions
- Limited runs

**Tactic 3: Price Rises and Time Limits**
Only effective if GENUINE:
- True discount for very short period (< 24 hours)
- Real price increase after deadline
- Never fake scarcity—consumers will figure it out

#### Step 3.4: Conduct Sales Conversations (Not Chit-Chat)

| Sales Conversation | Chit-Chat |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Scripted | Unscripted |
| Brochures/materials present | No materials |
| Asks for the business | Leaves open-ended |
| Results in signed form or CRM notes | Forgotten |
| Makes business work | Doesn't |

#### Step 3.5: Set Targets and Stay Firm
**Do NOT:**
- Raise prices mid-campaign (even if demand surges)
- Expand capacity beyond stated limits

**Why:**
1. Exceeding capacity = everyone gets let down
2. People learn not to trust your word
3. Every person turned away is advertising for your brand

### PHASE 4: Remarkable Delivery

#### Step 4.1: Understand Energy States

| Energy | Source | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **UP** | Delight, surprise, unexpected caring | People talk positively |
| **DOWN** | Disappointment, unmet expectations | People talk negatively |
| **SIDEWAYS** | Satisfaction, met expectations | People don't talk |

**Only "UP" energy generates word-of-mouth**

#### Step 4.2: The Surprise Principle
- Sell only 70% of what you intend to deliver
- Dial back promises so delivery exceeds expectations
- Keep magic up your sleeve

*If you promise 6 weeks and deliver in 4, they're ecstatic. Promise 3 days and deliver in 4, they're disappointed.*

#### Step 4.3: Conduct Remarkable Audit
Score every touchpoint 1–10:
- Website
- Brochures
- People interactions
- Products
- Premises
- Ads
- Staff handbook
- Uniforms
- Packaging
- Communications

*Ask: "Is this touchpoint positively remarkable?"*

#### Step 4.4: Technology as Enabler
Every business is now also a technology business:
- CRM for client interactions
- Automation for delivery
- Follow-up systems and reminders
- Fast web page creation
- Data collection and utilization

### PHASE 5: Celebrate and Innovate

#### Step 5.1: Capture Stories
- Client success stories
- Behind-the-scenes stories
- Origin/journey stories
- Transformation stories

*Expensive watches = Swiss location + powerful story*

#### Step 5.2: Capture Numbers
- Campaign results
- Conversion rates by signal type
- Cost per acquisition
- Net Promoter Score
- Revenue per client

#### Step 5.3: Conduct Debrief
Questions to answer:
- What worked?
- What didn't work?
- What should we do differently?
- What should we keep?
- What did we learn about our market?

#### Step 5.4: Party and Rest
- Celebrate wins with the team
- Reward contributors
- Take genuine downtime before next campaign
- Resist temptation to immediately start next campaign

## Part 4: Supporting Concepts

### The "Famous for 5,000" Framework
You don't need mass fame. Target being known by 5,000 people in your niche.

**Five ingredients for niche fame:**

| Ingredient | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Consistent Message** | Repeat same clear message 7–15 times until it sticks |
| **Content** | Articles, blogs, books, videos, podcasts for people to discover |
| **Commercial Ecosystem** | Products at multiple price points (£100, £1,000, £10,000+) |
| **Continuity** | Online profile showing your history + ways to follow future |
| **Collaboration** | Framework for partnerships with others famous to similar group |

### Clients vs. Customers Distinction

| Clients | Customers |
|---------|-----------|
| Ongoing relationship | Transactional |
| Higher value | Higher volume |
| Personal attention | Systematized service |
| Selective acceptance | Open acceptance |

### Net Promoter Score (NPS)
**The question:** "How likely are you to recommend this business to someone like yourself?" (0–10)

- Below 7 average = no growth potential
- Higher scores = predictor of growth and profitability

**Four ways to improve NPS:**
1. Build a better product
2. Build better delivery systems
3. Change target market (right product, wrong audience = low NPS)
4. Change expectations (manage what marketing/sales promise)

### The Product Ecosystem

```
Products-for-Prospects → Core Offering → Premium/Extended Services
     (Low cost)            (Main revenue)      (High value)
```

Each level qualifies people for the next.

## Part 5: Common Traps and Mistakes

### Trap 1: Linear Thinking
**Mistake:** Meeting one client, selling, delivering, then finding the next
**Fix:** Cluster activities into campaigns; batch prospecting, selling, delivering

### Trap 2: Unknown Capacity
**Mistake:** Claiming you can serve "as many as want to buy"
**Fix:** Know your exact number for remarkable delivery; be honest about limits

### Trap 3: Asking for the Sale Too Early
**Mistake:** Pushing for purchase before 7 hours of engagement
**Fix:** Ask for signals; build relationship through education/entertainment first

### Trap 4: Releasing Before Oversubscribed
**Mistake:** Launching when you hope people will buy
**Fix:** Wait until signals hit thresholds (5x/10x/100x capacity)

### Trap 5: Over-Selling What You'll Deliver
**Mistake:** Promising 100% of what you can do
**Fix:** Sell 70%; deliver 100%+ (leave room for positive surprise)

### Trap 6: Raising Prices/Capacity Mid-Campaign
**Mistake:** Opportunistically increasing prices or capacity when demand surges
**Fix:** Stay firm; build trust; let people know you mean what you say

### Trap 7: Saying Yes to Everyone
**Mistake:** Taking any client who will pay
**Fix:** Say "no" to wrong-fit clients; they damage brand and drain energy

### Trap 8: Neglecting Sales Follow-Up
**Mistake:** Assuming interested people will buy on their own
**Fix:** Have sales conversations; follow up systematically; mop up after campaigns

### Trap 9: Skipping Celebrate & Innovate Phase
**Mistake:** Rushing into next campaign
**Fix:** Capture stories, numbers, and insights; rest; then start fresh

### Trap 10: Going Solo
**Mistake:** Trying to do everything yourself
**Fix:** Assemble a CDE team from day one (even 4 people covering key roles)
