# Building a StoryBrand 2.0: Complete Knowledge Base
*By Donald Miller | Comprehensive Reference Guide*

---

## Part 1: Core Concept

### What This Book Is About
Building a StoryBrand provides a universal framework for clarifying your marketing message so customers actually listen. It applies the proven structure of storytelling—used in every successful movie, novel, and narrative—to business messaging. The core insight: **customers don't buy the best products; they buy the products they can understand the fastest.**

### The Problem It Solves
Most businesses fail to grow not because they lack great products, but because potential customers can't figure out how those products will make their lives better. Companies create noise instead of music. They talk about themselves (their history, their mission, their awards) when customers only care about one thing: **"How will this help me survive and thrive?"**

### The Key Mental Model Shift
**Stop positioning your brand as the hero. Position your customer as the hero and your brand as the guide.**

Every human being wakes up seeing themselves as the protagonist of their own story. When your brand competes for the hero role, customers instinctively resist. But when you position yourself as the guide who helps them win, you become irresistible.

> "Heroes are weak, uncertain, and in need of help. Guides are strong, competent, and have been there before. Be the guide."

---

## Part 2: The SB7 Framework

### The Complete Story Formula
Every compelling story follows this structure:

> **A CHARACTER who wants something encounters a PROBLEM before they can get it. At the peak of their despair, a GUIDE steps into their lives, gives them a PLAN, and CALLS THEM TO ACTION. That action helps them avoid FAILURE and ends in SUCCESS.**

### The Seven Elements

| Element | Definition | Brand Application |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| 1. Character | The hero who wants something | Your customer (not you) |
| 2. Problem | What stands in their way | The challenge your product solves |
| 3. Guide | The helper with empathy + competency | Your brand |
| 4. Plan | Clear steps to succeed | Your process/methodology |
| 5. Call to Action | Challenge to act | Your direct and transitional CTAs |
| 6. Failure | What's at stake if they don't act | Negative consequences |
| 7. Success | The positive outcome | The transformation you deliver |

### How the Elements Connect
```
Customer has a DESIRE → blocked by a PROBLEM → meets YOU (Guide)
        ↓
You provide a PLAN → CALL them to action
        ↓
They avoid FAILURE → achieve SUCCESS → experience TRANSFORMATION
```

## Part 3: Step-by-Step Framework Deep Dive

### Element 1: A Character (The Customer)

**Principle:** *The customer is the hero, not your brand.*

**What to Define:**
- What does your customer want as it relates to your brand?
- The want should be simple, singular, and survival-related

**Survival Categories Customers Care About:**
| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Conserving financial resources | Saving/making money | "Save 20% on energy bills" |
| Conserving time | Efficiency, productivity | "Get 2 hours back each day" |
| Building social networks | Community, belonging | "Join a tribe of like-minded people" |
| Gaining status | Prestige, recognition | "Be seen as an industry leader" |
| Accumulating resources | Wealth, assets | "Grow your investment portfolio" |
| Showing generosity | Meaning, contribution | "Give back to your community" |

**Key Questions:**
- What does my customer want?
- What desire can I help them fulfill?
- Is this desire simple enough to fit in a sentence?

**Critical Rule:** Define ONE clear desire. Stories with multiple goals lose the audience.

---

### Element 2: Has a Problem

**Principle:** *Companies sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems.*

**The Three Levels of Problems:**

#### A. The Villain (Root Cause)
The villain is the source of all problems. It must be:
- A root source (not symptoms)
- Relatable and recognizable
- Singular (one villain, not many)
- Real (not manufactured fear)

**Examples of Good Villains:**
- High taxes → Broken government
- Intimidating technology → Overcomplicated design
- Time waste → Distractions
- Financial insecurity → Predatory practices

#### B. External Problem
The tangible, surface-level problem the villain causes.
- What your product literally solves
- The "thing" customers think they're buying

**Examples:**
| Business | External Problem |
|----------|-----------------|
| Plumber | Leaky pipe |
| Financial advisor | Need investment help |
| Restaurant | Hunger |
| Car dealership | Need reliable transportation |

#### C. Internal Problem  
The feeling the external problem creates—frustration, self-doubt, inadequacy.

**This is where purchasing decisions are actually made.**

| External Problem | Internal Problem (Feeling) |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Leaky pipe | Frustrated, incompetent |
| Intimidating technology | Stupid, overwhelmed |
| Ugly house | Embarrassed |
| Disorganized finances | Anxious, confused |

**Key Insight:** Apple didn't sell computers; they solved the internal problem of feeling intimidated by technology.

#### D. Philosophical Problem
The deeper injustice—what *ought* or *shouldn't* be.
- Adds meaning to the purchase
- Makes customers feel part of something bigger
- Creates brand evangelists

**Examples:**
| Brand | Philosophical Problem |
|-------|----------------------|
| Tesla | People shouldn't have to choose between performance and environment |
| Tom's Shoes | Every child deserves shoes |
| CarMax | People shouldn't be ripped off buying a car |

**The Perfect Brand Promise Framework:**
```
VILLAIN: [Root cause]
EXTERNAL: I need [tangible solution]
INTERNAL: I feel [frustration/emotion]  
PHILOSOPHICAL: It's wrong that [injustice]
```

**Example - Tesla:**
- Villain: Gas-guzzling, inferior technology
- External: I need a better car
- Internal: I want to be an early adopter
- Philosophical: My car choice ought to help the environment AND perform better

---

### Element 3: And Meets a Guide

**Principle:** *Customers aren't looking for another hero; they're looking for a guide.*

**Why Guides, Not Heroes:**
- Heroes are weak, uncertain, and need help
- Guides are strong, competent, and have already won
- Positioning as hero makes you competitive with the customer
- Positioning as guide makes you an ally

**The Two Essential Characteristics of a Guide:**

#### 1. Empathy
Demonstrate you understand their problem.

**Empathy Phrases:**
- "We understand how it feels to..."
- "Nobody should have to experience..."
- "Like you, we are frustrated by..."
- "We know what it's like when..."

**The Bill Clinton Principle:** "I feel your pain" won elections because it demonstrated empathy before offering solutions.

#### 2. Competency
Prove you can actually solve their problem.

**Ways to Demonstrate Competency:**
| Method | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Testimonials | "Here's what our clients say..." |
| Statistics | "We've helped 10,000+ businesses..." |
| Awards | "Winner of [Industry] Award" |
| Logos | Display clients you've worked with |
| Years of experience | "25 years in the industry" |
| Certifications | Professional credentials |

**Critical Balance:** Express empathy first, then demonstrate competency. Leading with competency alone comes off as arrogant.

---

### Element 4: Who Gives Them a Plan

**Principle:** *Customers trust a guide who gives them a plan in the form of baby steps.*

**Why Plans Work:**
- Reduces cognitive dissonance
- Makes the path forward clear
- Removes confusion (the enemy of sales)
- Creates stepping stones across the "river" of uncertainty

**Two Types of Plans:**

#### A. Process Plan (How-To Steps)
Shows customers exactly what to do.

**Rules:**
- 3-6 steps maximum
- Can be pre-purchase, post-purchase, or combined
- Name your plan for memorability

**Formula:**
```
Step 1: [Simple first action]
Step 2: [Next logical step]  
Step 3: [Outcome/result]
```

**Examples:**
| Business | Process Plan |
|----------|--------------|
| Financial Advisor | 1. Schedule a call 2. Get a customized plan 3. Enjoy peace of mind |
| Mattress Store | 1. Choose a mattress 2. We deliver it 3. We remove your old one |
| Software | 1. Download 2. Integrate your data 3. Transform your workflow |

#### B. Agreement Plan (Fear-Reducing Promises)
Alleviates fears about doing business with you.

**How to Create:**
1. List all customer fears/concerns about your industry
2. Counter each with a specific agreement/promise
3. Name your agreement for impact

**Examples:**
| Fear | Agreement |
|------|-----------|
| "Will I get ripped off?" | "No-haggle pricing guarantee" |
| "What if it doesn't work?" | "100% money-back guarantee" |
| "Will I be stuck with problems?" | "Lifetime support included" |

**Give Your Plan a Name:**
- "The Easy Installation Plan"
- "The World's Best Night's Sleep Plan"
- "Our Customer Satisfaction Agreement"

---

### Element 5: And Calls Them to Action

**Principle:** *Customers do not take action unless they are challenged to take action.*

**Why CTAs Are Non-Negotiable:**
- Bodies at rest stay at rest
- Passivity signals lack of belief in your product
- Customers need to be told exactly what to do
- Clarity = confidence = sales

**Two Types of Calls to Action:**

#### A. Direct Call to Action
Asks for the sale. Make it obvious, repeated, and bold.

**Examples:**
- Buy Now
- Schedule an Appointment
- Call Today
- Register Now
- Get Started
- Place Your Order

**Rules for Direct CTAs:**
- One primary, obvious button
- Repeat throughout website/materials
- Use contrasting color
- No passive language ("learn more" is weak)

#### B. Transitional Call to Action  
Builds relationship before asking for marriage.

**Purpose:**
1. Stakes claim to your territory
2. Creates reciprocity
3. Positions you as the guide
4. Captures contact information

**Examples:**
| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Downloadable guide | "5 Things Your Website Should Include" |
| Free webinar | "The Secrets to [Desired Outcome]" |
| Free trial | "Try it free for 30 days" |
| Sample | "Get your free sample" |
| Assessment | "Take our free assessment" |

**The Dating Metaphor:**
```
Direct CTA = "Will you marry me?"
Transitional CTA = "Can I take you on a date?"

Repeat cycle:
Direct → No → Transitional → Yes → Direct → No → Transitional → Yes... → Eventually → Yes
```

---

### Element 6: That Helps Them Avoid Failure

**Principle:** *Every human being is trying to avoid a tragic ending.*

**The Science of Loss Aversion:**
Nobel Prize research shows people are 2-3x more motivated to avoid loss than achieve gain. Use this.

**What's at Stake?**
You must answer: "What will the customer lose if they don't buy?"

**The Fear Appeal Framework:**
1. **Vulnerability:** "30% of homes have termite damage"
2. **Consequence:** "Termites can destroy your home"
3. **Solution:** "We offer complete home treatment"
4. **Call to Action:** "Call today for 10% off"

**How to Talk About Stakes:**
- Be specific about consequences
- Don't overdo it (salt, not main course)
- Connect to real pain points
- Make consequences relatable

**Examples by Industry:**
| Business | What's at Stake |
|----------|-----------------|
| Financial Advisor | Not being ready for retirement, confusion, hidden fees |
| Pet Store | A long, boring summer for your kids |
| Used Cars | Getting ripped off, stuck with a lemon |
| Home Audio | Living in a boring home, nobody wants to visit |

**The Stakes Sandwich:**
Use a little negative → then swing positive. The contrast amplifies both.

---

### Element 7: And Ends in Success

**Principle:** *Never assume people understand how your brand can change their lives. Tell them.*

**Three Ways to End a Story Successfully:**

#### 1. Status Resolution
Character achieves higher position or recognition.
- "Become the expert in your field"
- "Be the envy of your neighbors"
- "Get recognized for your leadership"

#### 2. Completeness Resolution  
Character obtains something that makes them whole.
- "Finally feel organized"
- "Have peace of mind"
- "Complete your collection"

#### 3. Self-Realization/Acceptance
Character reaches their potential or accepts themselves.
- "Become the person you were meant to be"
- "Embrace your true self"
- "Unlock your full potential"

**How to Define Success:**
Ask: "What will life look like after they use your product?"

**Examples:**
| Business | Success Vision |
|----------|----------------|
| Rugs | "A room that finally feels finished" |
| Ice cream | "A rich, creamy taste of heaven" |
| Camping gear | "Always prepared for adventure" |
| Financial advisor | "Confident about your future" |

**The Obligatory Scene Principle:**
Your marketing must close all three story loops:
- External problem → Solved
- Internal feeling → Resolved  
- Philosophical injustice → Corrected

---

### Bonus Element: The Transformation

**Principle:** *Brands that participate in their customers' identity transformation create passionate brand evangelists.*

**The Deepest Human Desire:**
People don't just want products—they want to become someone different, better, more capable.

**Define the Transformation:**
| From | To |
|------|-----|
| Confused → | Confident |
| Passive dog owner → | Every dog's hero |
| Anxious → | Peaceful |
| Overwhelmed → | In control |
| Amateur → | Expert |

**Key Question:** "How do our customers want their friends to describe them after using our product?"

**How Guides Affirm Transformation:**
In stories, guides explicitly tell heroes they've transformed. Do the same:
- Celebrate customer wins
- Send congratulations
- Share transformation stories
- Create "before/after" moments

---

## Part 4: Supporting Concepts

### The Grunt Test
Within 5 seconds of seeing your website, a caveman should be able to grunt:
1. What you offer
2. How it makes their life better
3. What to do to buy it

**Test:** Show your website to a stranger for 5 seconds. Can they answer all three?

### The One-Liner
A single sentence that clearly describes your offer.

**Formula:**
```
[PROBLEM] + [PRODUCT/SOLUTION] + [RESULT]
```

**Structure:**
1. State the problem your customer faces
2. Present your product as the solution
3. Describe the successful ending

**Example:**
"Most people feel overwhelmed by technology [problem]. Our simple setup service [solution] means you'll be enjoying your new devices within an hour [result]."

**Rules:**
- Keep it under 30 words
- Make it memorizable
- Test until it gets a reaction
- Include in email signatures, business cards, everywhere

## Part 5: Common Traps & Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Positioning as Hero
**The Error:** Talking about your origin story, your passion, your awards
**The Fix:** Talk about the customer's problems and desires instead

### Mistake #2: Noise Instead of Music
**The Error:** Too much information, complexity, clever copy
**The Fix:** Simple, clear messages that pass the grunt test

### Mistake #3: Focusing Only on External Problems
**The Error:** "We fix leaky pipes" (purely functional)
**The Fix:** Address internal feelings: "Never feel embarrassed about your home again"

### Mistake #4: Multiple Wants/Villains
**The Error:** "We help you save money AND time AND feel better AND impress others..."
**The Fix:** Pick ONE primary desire, ONE villain

### Mistake #5: Weak Calls to Action
**The Error:** "Learn more" or "Get started" (passive suggestions)
**The Fix:** "Buy Now" or "Schedule Your Free Consultation" (direct challenges)

### Mistake #6: No Stakes
**The Error:** Failing to show what's lost without your product
**The Fix:** Clearly define negative consequences of inaction

### Mistake #7: Not Painting Success
**The Error:** Assuming customers know how life will be better
**The Fix:** Explicitly describe the transformation they'll experience

### Mistake #8: Too Much Plan
**The Error:** Listing 10+ steps creates more confusion
**The Fix:** 3-6 steps maximum; break complex processes into phases

### Mistake #9: No Transitional CTA
**The Error:** Only asking for the sale with no relationship-building option
**The Fix:** Create lead generators that provide value before purchase

### Mistake #10: Forgetting Transformation
**The Error:** Selling features and benefits, not identity change
**The Fix:** Define who the customer becomes, not just what they get
