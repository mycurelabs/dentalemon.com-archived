# Part 1: Core Concept

## What This Book Is Fundamentally About

Strategic pricing is about **managing the relationship between value and price** to achieve sustainable profitability. It is not simply about setting optimal price levels—it encompasses all decisions that affect a company's ability to capture a fair share of the value it creates for customers.

The core insight: **Demand is not "given"—it is created by decisions sellers make** about what to offer, how to communicate value, how to price across segments, and how to manage customer expectations. Strategic pricing means actively influencing willingness-to-pay rather than merely reacting to it.

## The Problem It Solves

Most companies fail at pricing because they use one of three flawed approaches:

| Flawed Approach | What It Is | Why It Fails |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Cost-Plus Pricing** | Price = Costs + Margin | Unit costs depend on volume, which depends on price—circular logic. Leads to overpricing in weak markets and underpricing in strong ones |
| **Customer-Driven Pricing** | Let customers dictate price | Sophisticated buyers conceal true willingness-to-pay; trains customers that objections are rewarded with discounts |
| **Share-Driven Pricing** | Cut price to gain share | Price cuts are easily matched, offering only temporary advantage at permanent margin loss |

## The Mental Model Shift

**From:** Determining sales levels → calculating unit costs → setting price to cover costs

**To:** Estimating value customers will pay → determining what costs can be profitably incurred → designing products/services within that constraint

> *"The key to profitable pricing is to recognize that customers in the marketplace, not costs, determine what a product can sell for."*

# Part 2: Main Framework—The Value Cascade

## The Six-Element Strategic Pricing Framework

The **Value Cascade** represents six interdependent choices that build upon each other. Gaps at any level dissipate profit potential before a product is even offered for sale.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         VALUE CREATION                  │  ← What value can we create?
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│       VALUE COMMUNICATION               │  ← How do we convey that value?
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         PRICE STRUCTURE                 │  ← How do we price differently across segments?
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         PRICING POLICY                  │  ← What rules govern pricing decisions?
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│          PRICE LEVEL                    │  ← What specific prices do we set?
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│       PRICE COMPETITION                 │  ← How do we respond to competitors?
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Element 1: Value Creation
Design products/services that create value customers will pay for—not just features engineering thinks are impressive.

**Key principle:** Start with target price based on estimated value, then design to costs that make that price profitable.

### Element 2: Value Communication
Translate differentiated benefits into customer perceptions of a fair price premium.

**Key principle:** Customers' willingness-to-pay depends not just on actual value but on *perceived* value. Marketing must close this gap.

### Element 3: Price Structure
Charge different prices to different customers/applications to reflect differences in value and cost-to-serve.

**Key principle:** One price rarely optimizes profit. Segment through offer configurations, price metrics, and price fences.

### Element 4: Pricing Policy
Establish rules for managing price exceptions that maintain price integrity while allowing flexibility.

**Key principle:** Without policies, pricing becomes reactive and controlled by customers rather than the seller.

### Element 5: Price Level
Set specific prices within the "reasonable range" bounded by economic value (ceiling) and competitor prices/variable costs (floor).

**Key principle:** Use breakeven analysis to evaluate whether likely sales changes justify proposed price changes.

### Element 6: Price Competition
Manage competitive dynamics thoughtfully—most price wars are negative-sum games.

**Key principle:** Never assume you must match a competitor's price. Evaluate the strategic implications first.

## Three Principles of Successful Pricing Strategies

1. **Value-Based:** Price differences reflect differences in value to customers
2. **Proactive:** Shape customer expectations rather than react to them
3. **Profit-Driven:** Prioritize sustainable profitability over volume or share

# Part 3: Step-by-Step Processes

## Process A: Economic Value Estimation (EVE®) Model

The EVE® Model calculates the maximum price a fully-informed customer would pay.

### Formula
```
Total Economic Value = Reference Value + Differentiation Value
```

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Identify the Reference Product**
- What is the customer's next-best competitive alternative (NBCA)?
- What price does the competitor charge for that alternative?
- This becomes the "Reference Value"

**Step 2: Identify Differentiation Value Drivers**
- What monetary benefits does your product provide vs. the reference? (cost savings, revenue gains, productivity)
- What psychological benefits? (convenience, security, prestige, peace of mind)

**Step 3: Quantify Each Value Driver**
For monetary value drivers, calculate:
- Revenue drivers: increased sales, higher prices customer can charge
- Cost drivers: labor savings, materials savings, reduced waste, lower inventory
- Opportunity costs avoided: faster time-to-market, reduced downtime

**Step 4: Sum to Calculate Total Economic Value**
```
EVE = Reference Price + Σ(Positive Differentiation) - Σ(Negative Differentiation)
```

### Key Questions at Each Stage

| Stage | Questions to Ask |
|-------|------------------|
| Reference Product | What would customers buy if we didn't exist? What do they pay for it? |
| Value Drivers | What do customers care about most? What causes their costs or revenues to change? |
| Quantification | What data exists? Can we verify with customer interviews? |
| Application | How does value differ by segment? What portion can we capture in price? |

---

## Process B: Six-Step Price-Setting Process

### Step 1: Define the Viable Price Range

**Price Ceiling:** Total Economic Value (EVE)
- Maximum theoretical price any fully-informed customer would pay

**Price Floor:** 
- For positively differentiated products: Competitor's price
- For negatively differentiated products: Variable cost

### Step 2: Establish Pricing Objectives

Choose a strategic positioning:

| Strategy | When to Use | Characteristics |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Skim Pricing** | High differentiation, protection from competition, price-insensitive segment exists | Capture high margins from less price-sensitive buyers first |
| **Penetration Pricing** | Cost/resource advantage, low variable costs, competitors can't/won't match | Build volume to leverage economies and lock out competitors |
| **Neutral Pricing** | No basis for skim or penetration; price-sensitive customers, protective competitors | Balance margin and volume; minimize price as a competitive factor |

### Step 3: Assess Breakeven Sales Changes

Calculate how much volume must change for a price change to be profitable:

**For a price cut:**
```
% Breakeven Sales Change = -(-ΔPrice) / (CM% + (-ΔPrice))
```

**For a price increase:**
```
% Breakeven Sales Change = -(+ΔPrice) / (CM% + (+ΔPrice))
```

Where CM% = Contribution Margin Percentage

**Example:** 10% price cut with 45% contribution margin
```
Breakeven = -(-10%) / (45% + (-10%)) = 10% / 35% = 28.6% sales increase required
```

### Step 4: Gauge Price Elasticity

Estimate whether the required sales change is achievable using:
- Historical transaction data
- Natural experiments (past price changes)
- Pricing research (conjoint analysis, buy-response surveys)
- Managerial judgment about market conditions

### Step 5: Account for Psychological Factors

Consider factors that affect price sensitivity beyond value:

| Factor | Effect on Price Sensitivity |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Reference Value Effect | Customers use reference products to assess value—manage which reference they use |
| Switching Costs | Higher switching costs = lower price sensitivity |
| Difficult Comparison Effect | When hard to compare alternatives, price sensitivity decreases |
| End-Benefit Effect | When product is small portion of larger benefit, price sensitivity decreases |
| Price-Quality Effect | When price signals quality, sensitivity decreases for high prices |
| Expenditure Effect | Larger purchases = more price sensitivity |
| Shared-Cost Effect | When someone else pays part of cost, price sensitivity decreases |
| Fairness Effect | Prices perceived as unfair trigger resistance regardless of value |

### Step 6: Communicate Price Changes Effectively

For price increases:
- Link to costs (fair) or value improvements (justified)
- Offer options/choices rather than mandating acceptance
- Consider unbundling to provide lower-value option at old price
- Phase in gradually where possible

## Process C: Value-Based Segmentation

### Six Steps to Segment by Value

**Step 1:** Determine criteria that cause value to differ across customers
- Usage intensity
- Application type  
- Cost-to-serve differences
- Competitive alternatives available

**Step 2:** Identify specific value drivers for each potential segment
- Which benefits matter most?
- What are the monetary implications?

**Step 3:** Determine operational constraints and competitive advantages
- Where can you deliver superior value cost-effectively?
- Where are competitors stronger?

**Step 4:** Create primary and secondary segments
- Primary: Most important differentiating criterion (often strategic overlap between customer needs and your capabilities)
- Secondary: Further divide primary segments by next-most-important criterion

**Step 5:** Create detailed segment descriptions
- Firmographics/demographics
- Buying behaviors
- Value drivers
- Representative customers

**Step 6:** Develop segment metrics and fences
- Metrics: How customers pay (per unit, per use, subscription, etc.)
- Fences: Policies that keep segments separated and pricing intact

---

# Part 4: Supporting Concepts

## A. Price Structure Tools

### 1. Offer Configurations (Bundles)
Use bundling to:
- Capture more value by combining elements valued differently by different segments
- Enable segment-specific pricing without explicit price discrimination
- Attract price-sensitive segments with low-cost additions

**Selective Uglification:** Add features that kill value for high-price segments while not affecting low-price segments (e.g., Saturday night stay requirement for discount airfare)

### 2. Price Metrics
How you measure what customers pay for.

**Criteria for good metrics:**
| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Tracks with Value | Higher-value uses pay more |
| Tracks with Cost | Higher-cost customers pay more |
| Easy to Implement | Objectively measurable, unambiguous |

**Types:**
- Per unit, per use, per time period
- Performance-based (pay for results)
- Tie-ins (razors/blades model)
- Subscription vs. transaction

### 3. Price Fences
Policies that segment customers and prevent arbitrage.

| Fence Type | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| Buyer Identification | Student/senior discounts, membership requirements |
| Purchase Location | Online vs. in-store, geographic pricing |
| Time of Purchase | Early bird, peak/off-peak, advance purchase |
| Purchase Quantity | Volume discounts, order minimums |

---

## B. Behavioral Economics Effects

| Effect | Description | Pricing Implication |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Competitive Reference** | Customers use reference products as anchors | Manage which competitor they compare you to |
| **Difficult Comparison** | When hard to compare, customers rely on heuristics | Use price as quality signal; leverage brand reputation |
| **End-Benefit** | Small cost in context of larger benefit seems trivial | Frame price relative to total benefit value |
| **Price-Quality** | High price signals high quality | Don't underprice premium offerings |
| **Expenditure** | Large absolute amounts trigger scrutiny | Break into smaller components if possible |
| **Shared-Cost** | Others paying reduces sensitivity | Target corporate accounts, expense-account buyers |
| **Transaction Value** | Customers seek "good deals" beyond just value | Provide sense of savings (from reference price, bundled value) |
| **Fairness** | Perceived unfairness triggers rejection | Frame increases as cost pass-throughs; offer options |

---

## C. Financial Analysis Framework

### Incremental vs. Non-Incremental Costs

| Cost Type | Definition | Role in Pricing |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Incremental Variable** | Changes with each unit sold | Always relevant; directly affects contribution margin |
| **Incremental Fixed** | Changes as result of pricing decision (e.g., advertising for new price point) | Include in breakeven calculation |
| **Non-Incremental Fixed** | Unaffected by pricing decision | Ignore when evaluating price changes (but must be covered overall) |
| **Sunk Costs** | Already incurred, cannot be recovered | Never relevant to pricing decisions |

### Contribution Margin Formula
```
Contribution Margin = Price - Variable Costs
CM% = (Price - Variable Costs) / Price
```

### Breakeven with Variable Cost Changes
```
% Breakeven = -(ΔPrice - ΔVariableCost) / (Original CM + (ΔPrice - ΔVariableCost))
```

---

## D. Competitive Response Framework

### Four Questions Before Responding to Competitor Price Cuts

1. **Is there a response that costs less than the preventable sales loss?**
   - Consider non-price responses (better service, bundled value, loyalty programs)
   - If not, ignore the competitor

2. **Will the competitor cut again if you match?**
   - If competitor has little to lose (low share, sunk costs), they'll keep cutting
   - Matching leads to price war you can't win

3. **Will the total cost of matching exceed the avoidable sales loss?**
   - Calculate multiple rounds of price cuts, not just the first
   - Include margin loss on retained customers

4. **Is your position in other markets at risk?**
   - Sometimes defending one market prevents spillover to others
   - But beware justifying retaliation with vague "strategic" reasons

### Managing Competitive Information

**Collect:**
- Monitor competitor prices systematically
- Verify customer claims about competitive offers
- Track win/loss patterns

**Communicate:**
- Signal commitment to defend (price-match policies)
- Announce capacity expansions or cost improvements
- Make clear the consequences of aggressive pricing

# Part 5: Common Traps and Mistakes

## Strategic Pricing Mistakes

| Mistake | Description | Correct Approach |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Pricing to cover costs** | Allocating fixed costs to determine price | Let value determine price; then decide what costs to incur |
| **Pricing to customer willingness** | Accepting whatever customers say they'll pay | Raise willingness-to-pay through value communication |
| **Pricing for market share** | Cutting price to gain volume | Focus on profitable volume; share follows good value |
| **Assuming more features = more value** | Loading products with features customers won't pay for | Research value before incurring costs |
| **Ignoring reference products** | Pricing in isolation from competitive context | Always establish what customers compare you to |
| **Reactive discounting** | Conceding to price objections without policy | Use give-get tactics; maintain price integrity |
| **Matching competitor prices reflexively** | Assuming you must match any competitive move | Analyze whether matching is profitable before responding |
| **Underpricing innovations** | Asking uninformed customers what they'd pay | Price to reflect full value; invest in communicating it |

## Pricing Policy Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| No policies for price exceptions | Pricing controlled by customers and sales reps | Create proactive give-get policies |
| Revenue-only sales incentives | Sales team discounts excessively | Align incentives with profitability |
| Negotiating without trade-offs | Every concession is pure margin loss | Require "gives" for every "get" |
| Promotional discounting to drive trial | Trains customers to wait for deals | Use non-price incentives (free trials, gifts, bundles) |
| Inconsistent discount policies | Customers learn to manipulate the system | Standardize and enforce discount criteria |

## Value Estimation Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| **Assuming X% better = X% higher price** | Value depends on benefit importance, not just improvement magnitude | Calculate actual monetary value of improvement |
| **Using customer value modeling (CVM) fair-value lines** | Undervalues differentiated products by averaging | Use EVE model separating reference and differentiation value |
| **Ignoring psychological value** | Many purchases driven by non-monetary factors | Include prestige, security, convenience in value estimation |
| **Taking shortcuts on research** | "Obvious" value estimates are often wrong | Do rigorous customer interviews and quantitative research |

└──────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘
```

### Organizational Structure Options

| Archetype | When to Use | Characteristics |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Centralized Pricing** | Commoditized products, yield management focus | All pricing decisions at corporate level |
| **Center of Expertise** | Similar markets across business units | Central group provides tools/analytics; units execute |
| **Dedicated Support Units** | Diversified businesses, little market overlap | Each unit has own pricing function; loose corporate alignment |

### Decision Rights Framework

| Right Type | Description | Who Typically Holds |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Input** | Provide data/analysis for decision | Finance, research, forecasting |
| **Make** | Actually set the price (single owner) | Product manager, pricing manager |
| **Ratify** | Veto decisions conflicting with strategy | Senior management |
| **Notify** | Be informed of decisions | Sales, operations, product development |

### Key Processes to Define

1. **Opportunity Assessment** — Evaluating pricing potential of new products/markets
2. **Price Setting** — How list prices are determined and updated
3. **Discount Approval** — Who can approve what level of exception
4. **Negotiation Guidelines** — Give-get policies and trade-off menus
5. **Competitive Response** — How/when to react to competitive moves
6. **Price Review** — Periodic reassessment of price levels

### Analytics for Price Management

| Analysis Type | Purpose | Key Metrics |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| **Win-Loss Analysis** | Understand competitive position | Win rate by segment, price point, competitor |
| **Customer Profitability** | Identify profitable vs. unprofitable accounts | Revenue minus cost-to-serve by customer |
| **Price Band Analysis** | Identify excessive discounting | Distribution of transaction prices vs. list |
| **Price Waterfall** | Find margin leaks | Breakdown from list → invoice → pocket price |

### Change Management Essentials

1. **Senior management sponsorship** — Pricing change fails without top-level commitment
2. **Demonstration projects** — Prove concept works before organization-wide rollout
3. **Quick wins** — Build momentum with visible early successes
4. **Training** — Sales team must understand value selling and policies
5. **Incentive realignment** — Compensation must support pricing strategy
